radio_app  v0.15 README

A small app to download radio programs from the BBC iPlayer, using flvstreamer.

Dependencies:

Perl:
IPC::Run

To stream and listen to a radio station, flvstreamer, mplayer

To stream and record a radio station, flvstreamer, ffmpeg, lame

To download a radio program flvstreamer, ffmpeg

Usage examples:

To list available channels

./radio_app --help
(the list is embedded into the program, it does not fetch a list, should be possible to add more if needed)

To download a live stream which will convert from aac to mp3

./radio_app --channel 5 --end 30 --chunk 5 --live --outdir $HOME

if flvstreamer crashes for whatever reason an additional chunk will be stuck on the end to compensate

To download a live stream which will be aac in a mp4 container (v. low cpu)

./radio_app --channel 5 --end 30 --chunk 5 --live --raw --outdir $HOME

To play a live stream

./radio_app --channel 6 --live --play

To search for a program

./radio_app --channel 5 --find bacon --find "day sunday"

To search for a program added in the last 24hrs

./radio_app --channel 5 --find bacon --find "day sunday" --since 24

(Can also search by PID b00.., but this needs to be an exact match)

To get all results:

./radio_app --channel 5 --find bacon --find "day sunday" --get --outdir $HOME

To dump a PID direct:
./radio_app --dumppid b00..... --title "Title Here" (The title is needed because the pid xml,doesn't have it.)

In order to use my Joggler (see jogglerwiki.info) as an internet radio, I have added a primitive GUI, which lets you stream the radio stations, control the volume and start a slideshow. You can call this by running:

./radio_app --gui

It is written in perl gtk2 and it is probably too specific to be of too much use to anyone else, the modules will only load if there is a DISPLAY set on the machine where the app is run. If you don't want to load perl gtk2 and do have a DISPLAY, then I suggest you comment them out. Or tell me how to accomplish that.
